## Gameplay Documentation (Final)

This section of the repository will hold all ideas related to potential gameplay improvements. 

### Level Ideas:     
- **Mix Of Both (i.e. Spelunky, Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon)** 
    - Regular rooms get randomly generated, Boss rooms/Special/Other rooms are hand crafted 
        - Provides some consistency while leaving a bit up to random chance

## Weapon Ideas:
- **Perks**
    - Weapons provide different benefits/changes to different perks 

### Gameplay Ideas: 
- **Parrying** 
    - Dark souls-esk (one pary, longer cooldown)
        - want the focus to be on movement
        - *Probably going to tie this to a weapon*

- **Dodging**   
    - Shift/CTRL to dodge
        - structure it to be a dash instead of a roll
        - multiple dodges before cooldown procs    

- **Bullet Hell**
    - Keeps the player engaged
