## Gameplay Documentation

This section of the repository will hold all ideas related to potential gameplay improvements. 

### Level Ideas: 
- **Randomly generated**
    - could randomly generate everything or only a few things
        - Levels
        - Enemies/Enemy Types
        - Items/Weapons/Perks
        - Chests/openables 
    - Provides a great amount of replayability
        - Can cause multiple balancing/other issues during creation
        
- **Hand Crafted** 
    - Can be more reliable for speedrunning stuff
        - Consistency in levels could be good for the countdown we were thinking about
    - Can ensure that there are beautiful backgrounds
        - Prevents random generation from creating errors in level design/item placement
        
- **Mix Of Both** 
    - Regular rooms get randomly generated, Boss rooms/Special/Other rooms are hand crafted 
        - Provides some consistency while leaving a bit up to random chance
            - (Dead Cells)
            - (Spelunky)
            - (Enter the Gungeon)
        
        
### Gameplay Ideas:
- **Bullet hell where every attack can be deflected**
    - Parry System
        - Combo meter (potentially)
            - higher score at the end of each level
                - Maybe stat benefits as the combo gets higher
                - Maybe more perks for better scores
        - Potentiality for rythm implementation (need to build the game around this if we want to pursue this)
    - Quick Recharging Dodge  
- **Boss rush**
    - Core gameplay/side mode after beating the game
- **Distructable Terrain**
    - May be complicated depending on if we want to randomly generate levels or not
- **Randomly Generated components**
    - Perk system
        - End of Level Freebies (gain a perk after beating a boss, maybe 2 if you perfect it)
        - Level up after gathering a certain amount of xp/money/whatever from beating enemies
        - Start out slow (minor life steal, extra health/speed/damage), end crazy (Homing x Explosive shots, slower enemies/shots, resurect once, every hit without getting hit multiplies damage 1.2x, for any damage taken deal back 3x to all enemies on screen)
    - Random levels/enemy placement
    - Random weapons (could also make it like a hero shooter where each character has a specific weapon/ability and they can only level those up)
