## Gameplay Documentation

This section of the repository will hold all ideas related to potential gameplay improvements. 

### Gameplay Ideas:
- Bullet hell where every attack can be deflected
    - Parry system
- Boss rush (core gameplay/side mode after beating the game)
- Distructable Terrain (? may be complicated depending on if we want to randomly generate levels or not)
- Randomly Generated components 
    - Perk system
        - End of Level Freebies (gain a perk after beating a boss, maybe 2 if you perfect it)
        - Level up after gathering a certain amount of xp/money/whatever from beating enemies
        - Start out slow (minor life steal, extra health/speed/damage), end crazy (Homing x Explosive shots, slower enemies/shots, resurect once, every hit without getting hit multiplies damage 1.2x, for any damage taken deal back 3x to all enemies on screen)
    - Random levels/enemy placement
    - Random weapons (could also make it like a hero shooter where each character has a specific weapon/ability and they can only level those up)
