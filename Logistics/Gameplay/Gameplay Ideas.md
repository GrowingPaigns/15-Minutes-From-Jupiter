## Gameplay Documentation

This section of the repository will hold all ideas related to potential gameplay improvements. 

### Level Ideas: 
- **Randomly Generated (i.e. Risk of Rain, Rogue Legacy)**
    - could randomly generate everything or only a few things
        - Levels
        - Enemies/Enemy Types
        - Items/Weapons/Perks
        - Chests/openables 
    - Provides a great amount of replayability
        - Can cause multiple balancing/other issues during creation
 
        
- **Mix Of Both (i.e. Spelunky, Dead Cells, Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon)** 
    - Regular rooms get randomly generated, Boss rooms/Special/Other rooms are hand crafted 
        - Provides some consistency while leaving a bit up to random chance
            - (Dead Cells)
            - (Spelunky)
            - (Enter the Gungeon)

- **Destructible Objects**

- **Distructable Terrain**
    - May be complicated depending on if we want to randomly generate levels or not
        
### Player Gameplay Ideas:
- **Bullet hell where every attack can be deflected**
    - Parry System
        - Combo meter (potentially)
            - higher score at the end of each level
                - Maybe stat benefits as the combo gets higher
                - Maybe more perks for better scores
        - Potentiality for rythm implementation (need to build the game around this if we want to pursue this)
    - Quick Recharging Dodge  
    
- **Boss Rush**
    - Core gameplay/side mode after beating the game

- **Randomly Generated Components**
    - Perk system
        - End of Level Freebies (gain a perk after beating a boss, maybe 2 if you perfect it)
        - Level up after gathering a certain amount of xp/money/whatever from beating enemies
        - Start out slow (minor life steal, extra health/speed/damage)
            - end crazy (Homing x Explosive shots, slower enemies/shots, resurect once, every hit without getting hit multiplies damage 1.2x, for any damage taken deal back 3x to all enemies on screen)
    - Random levels/enemy placement
    - Random weapons (could also make it like a hero shooter where each character has a specific weapon/ability and they can only level those up)

- **Perk Trees**
    - Instead of gaining perks randomly, we could implement multiple perk trees with different play styles
        - Either confine the player to one skill tree path
        - Or let them level all of them (up to the number of points they're given)
    - Give the player points to spend instead of random perks
        - Could either let them pick perks from the tree hierarchy as they please, 
        - or restrict them to leveling up earlier perks before getting OP ones 
    - Could make all of the available perks base level
        - Have certain perks combine/level up as they get perchased 

### Enemy Gameplay Ideas:
- **Different Bullet/Attacks for each enemy**

- **Enemies Have Perks**
    - Could gain perks as time goes on
    - Could just have 1-2 perks permanently (some teleport, others rush you and explode if you get too close)

- **Swarms**
    - Some enemy types could be ultra low health but high in numbers 

- **Environmental Traps**
