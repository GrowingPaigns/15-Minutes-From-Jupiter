## Project Timeline

### Need to Implement:
- Movement 
  - Start with basic movement (WASD) 
    - Jumping (Different levels of jump?)
      - Hold to jump higher/farther 
      - W and Spacebar, ^ are key options
    - Slide 
      - CTRL, C, and S are key options 
    - Dodging
      - Shift 
    - Want controls to be tight and responsive, not slipery 
      - End with any super movement

  - Gradually add changes to movement as the player upgrades themselves/their weapon

- Weapons
  - Start with fist, get sword and item from tutorial enemy after killing them
  - Each weapon has positives and negatives 
    - Shield makes you slower but higher health  
    - Light weapon makes you dodge further/faster
  - Each weapon has a skill tree allowing for crazy combinations
