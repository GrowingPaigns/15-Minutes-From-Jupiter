	**The start of the story...**

	- Long ago an eldritch deity took form. In order to evolve within the harsh absence of the celestial void, it took to devouring the energy produced by stars.
	    - This process, when it was young, was painfully slow. As a relativly weak being, it could neither get too close to a star nor too far away from one less it would be melted by solar radiation, or frozen in the absence of space. Because of this, it learned how to ride along the gravitational waves of these massive bodies, while ever so gradually increasing its strength. It would continue this agonizingly slow training, gradually growing towards the point where it could eat chunks of stars whole. Though in this time, it would also learn of truly how empty the universe is. As it traveled from system to system, it would begin to starve, and break down its own bodily structure, physically reducing its size so that it wouldnt perish before its next meal.
	- After eons of change, the unnatual being became the size of a small moon, and in this evolution, gained new ways to increase its efficiency at harvesting cosmic energy, and spreading its influence.
	    - It had learned how to create a cocoon around itself using bodily byproduct. This vastly increased its surface area, until it was much larger than an other planet in the system, which allowed it to soak up more solar power than itd be able to on its own. However, the downfall of this cocoon would be that it caused the undescribable mass to enter a comatose state for hundreds of thousands of years at a time as it gradually regained strength, and size.
	    	- This cocoon was not left defenseless however, as the beast slumbered, its body still naturally produces byproduct, which seeps through the cracks in its shell. These byproducts, minerals, gasses, and liquids, would eventually facilitate the growth of new life. Relatives, if not direct descendants of the deity, these beings were far more powerful than any lifeforms in their respective galaxies, though they often fell quite a bit short intelectually, only ever mumbling one barely intelligible word; Jupiter. 
		- Although, these lesser creatures were nothing like kin to the creature. For once Jupiter had completely absorbed the power its chosen star, it would errupt from its shell, scattering the outer debris of its cocoon, and all of the residents therwithin, across the expanses of the void.
	 - After finding its most recent roost in our solar system, however, things took a turn for life on Jupiter. Whether it be because of the harmony of our system, or from the evolved output of Jupiter's bodily waste, intelligent, resourceful, and hardy beings were born.
	 
	 - As one of the more recently born of this eldritch species, you (the player) are also one of the fittest generations born yet. Your story picks up millions of years into Jupiter's evolution, just as it is about to break free from its cocoon. The eldest surviving sage of your species has been studying the makeup of your planet their entire life, and has foretold of a great catastrophe in the near future after having witnessed the horror that slumbers within. He declares war on the god, something must be done, teams must be assembled to slay the creature less the entire world ends. Nearly as soon as the words stumble from his mouth, the ground begins to shake, great plumes of gas and smoke fill the sky, and the grass gives way below your feet.
	 - Now isolated underground with no way back up, the only way left to go is down into the spiraling darkness. Will you evolve, survive, and anihilate Jupiter before the world before you crumbles to nothingness, or will you simply fade into obscurity as the ones who existed before you did?

Gameplay Ideas:
- Bullet hell where every attack can be deflected
    - Parry system
- Boss rush (core gameplay/side mode after beating the game)
- Distructable Terrain (? may be complicated depending on if we want to randomly generate levels or not)
- Randomly Generated components 
    - Perk system
        - End of Level Freebies (gain a perk after beating a boss, maybe 2 if you perfect it)
        - Level up after gathering a certain amount of xp/money/whatever from beating enemies
        - Start out slow (minor life steal, extra health/speed/damage), end crazy (Homing x Explosive shots, slower enemies/shots, resurect once, every hit without getting hit multiplies damage 1.2x, for any damage taken deal back 3x to all enemies on screen)
    - Random levels/enemy placement
    - Random weapons (could also make it like a hero shooter where each character has a specific weapon/ability and they can only level those up)
