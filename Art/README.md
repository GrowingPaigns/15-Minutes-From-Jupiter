## Art and Animations

Currently, this part of the repository holds beta art for some character, item, and menu ideas
------

### Important Notes:
In order to directly import sprite sheets into a GM sprite...
- animations must be split up (no collective sheets)
- Animation names must follow this convention:
  - **s<Animation Name>_strip#.png**
    - in this, "<Animation Name>" is replaced by your specific title
    - strip# refers to the number of frames in an animation (replace # with num of frames)
