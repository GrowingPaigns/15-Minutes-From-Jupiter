## Art and Animations

Currently, this part of the repository holds beta art for some character, item, and menu ideas

### Important Notes:
In order to directly import sprite sheets into a GM sprite...
- animations must be split up (no collective sheets)
- Animation names must follow this convention:
  - **s[Animation Name]_strip#.png**
    - in this, "[Animation Name]" is replaced by your specific title
    - strip# refers to the number of frames in an animation (replace # with num of frames)

- The general naming convention in gamemaker is to start the name with they type of asset you are creating
  - i.e. Sprite (sSpriteName), Object (oObjectName), Room, (rRoomName)
